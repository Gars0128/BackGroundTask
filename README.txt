Running the Application:
Setup:

Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.
Clone or download the application code from the repository.
Configuration:

Open the appsettings.json file and set the BackgroundTaskInterval value to the desired interval in milliseconds.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
Execute dotnet run to start the application.
Configuring the Background Task Interval:
Changing Interval at Runtime (Optional):
To dynamically change the interval:
Use the /api/Sample/configure-interval/{interval} endpoint, replacing {interval} with the desired interval in milliseconds.
Example: https://localhost:5001/api/Sample/configure-interval/600000 (for a 10-minute interval).
Accessing Logs:
Log Locations:

Logs are written using the .NET Core logging framework.
Logs can be found in the console output if running the application in a terminal.
Additionally, logs are stored in log files. By default, the logs are written to the logs folder within the application directory.
Interpreting Logs:

The logs contain information, warnings, and errors generated by the application.
Information logs (Information level) include details about when the background task starts, completes, and any generated random numbers.
Error logs (Error level) will capture exceptions that occur during the execution of the background task.
Summary:
Start the application with the specified background task interval set in appsettings.json.
Use the provided API endpoint to dynamically configure the interval if needed.
Check the console output and log files in the logs folder to view logs and monitor background task execution.

Prerequisites:
.NET Core SDK:
Ensure you have the .NET Core SDK installed. You can download it from dotnet.microsoft.com.
Steps to Set Up and Run the Application:
Clone or Download the Application:

Clone the repository or download the application source code.
Navigate to the Application Directory:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application code is located.
Set Background Task Interval (Optional):

Open the appsettings.json file in the project.
Modify the BackgroundTaskInterval value (in milliseconds) as desired.
Run the Application:

In the terminal or command prompt, execute the following command:
arduino
Copy code
dotnet run
This command will build and run the application.
Access the Endpoints:

Once the application is running, you can access the endpoints.
Use a web browser or API testing tool (e.g., Postman) to interact with the provided endpoints.
Example endpoint for starting the background task: https://localhost:5001/api/Sample/start-background-task
Example endpoint for configuring the interval: https://localhost:5001/api/Sample/configure-interval/{interval}
View Logs:

Logs are displayed in the console output where the application is running.
Additionally, logs are stored in log files located in the logs folder within the application directory.
Interpret Logs:

Check the console output for logs regarding the background task starting, completing, and any errors encountered.
Log files in the logs folder contain detailed information, including generated random numbers or any exceptions logged during task execution.
Additional Notes:
Ensure that the necessary dependencies and packages are restored using dotnet restore before running the application.
If you encounter any issues, ensure that the required .NET Core SDK version is installed and the application dependencies are properly configured.
